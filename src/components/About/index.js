              I am currently doing my Masters in Computer Science from Queen Mary University of London. I have done my Bachelors of
              Technology in IT from NMIMS University in Mumbai. I have been programming in a variety of languages since I was in 6th grade.
              My passion for programming and the motivation is fueled by the prospects of making things which would be used by people around
              the world. <br />
              <br />I am currently working as a Data Science Project Intern at Teragence Ltd, London. I am working to improve their existing
              na√Øve signal estimator algorithms to smart AI/ML based estimation workflow. I am using technologies like QGIS, Python (Data
              Analysis libraries like Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, etc), Docker, Kubernetes, ReactJS. <br /> <br />I have previously worked in a
              startup as a Software Enginner where I used technologies like Swift, Python, NodeJS, ReactJS, Amazon Web Services, SQL,
              Firebase and Linux. Some of the projects I worked on are aarjaychairs.com, Before Visit app, Momma's Kitchen app.
              <br />
              <br />
              Aside from professional work I am also motivated to work on my own personal projects. Some of the projects include a few iOS
              Apps that I have published, contributions to StackOverFlow and other open source projects, current website and a Raspberry PI
              home NAS server that I have deployed. I am currently participating in a variety of online coding competitions like Google
              Kickstart, Google CodeJam, CodeChef, Hackerrank and Leetcode to improve my coding and problem solving skills.
